# Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twitter_bootstrap'
```

Then, run from your shell:

```
bundle install && rails g twitter_bootstrap:install
```

You should install another gem of mine here,
[will_paginate_twitter_bootstrap](https://github.com/travisjeffery/will_paginate_twitter_bootstrap), too. This gem fixes will_paginate to work with Twitter's Bootstrap.
